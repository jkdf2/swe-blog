# This past week

Wrapped up Collatz which was much nicer in Python than in C++. We learned about exceptions and Python data structures which, in their absurd simplicity, I absolutely love.

# In my way right now

I foresee nothing getting in my way; busy with Graphics and flying out for an interview in the coming week, but as long as I rest appropriately, I am not worried about it being too stressful.

# Next week

Just need to take care of myself and sleep right to avoid stressing over the future. Working on staying in the moment and taking things day-by-day.

# Class takeaways

I haven't learned too much new about Python yet.

# Pick of the week

Seek out opportunities outside of the big, lauded tech companies and you might find work that is more engaging, interesting, and meaningful.
