# This week in OOP

Shit got real, yo. We got into completely unfamiliar concepts in C++ including templating, transform and accumulate operations (synonymous with map and reduce - now I understand MapReduce, yay!), classes, constructors, destructors, and so on. On a deep level, I understand about 20% of what we've covered - but no worries, practice makes perfect so I have a plan of action to be ready for Thursday's exam.

# In my way right now

Fortunately, all of my other classes and my TA responsibilities are in a bit of a much-needed lull. This gives me time for two important things: prepping for the OOP exam and reflecting on how to stay on top of the rest of the semester. I greatly needed this reflection time to do a mental mid-point evaluation and reassess my study habits. From this point forward, I'm going to be starting algorithms homework on Sunday in a study group so we can discuss the harder concepts together and visit office hours on Monday and Tuesday before homework is due Wednesday. I'll be moving the less-important and less-difficult competitive programming work from Sunday to Wednesday in place of the last-minute algorithms panicking. This will overall reduce my stress and ensure I'm getting better grades in the classes that matter. 

# Next week

I'll be making fake C++ classes and implementing all of the concepts that we talked about in class.

# Tip of the week

In case you feel like you have some free time and want to hone in one of those massive number of skills CS majors are supposed to have by graduation (it's overwhelming, isn't it?), I know of the following awesome clubs UTCS students have organized to help with professional learning:

* [UTCS MAD](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MADstudentorg/) - Students lead weekly workshops in iOS, Android, and Web Development.

* [Information and Systems Security Society (ISSS)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/utisss/) - Weekly hands-on with practical security concepts led by our classmate [Brian Cui](https://thebriancui.github.io/CS371p_blog/).

* [Electronic Game Developers Society (EGaDS)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/egadsaustin/) - Not sure how frequently they meet but they have workshops and Game Jams (game creation hackathons)

* [ACM Competitive Programming](https://www.facebook.com/groups/utcompetitive/) - Biweekly Friday programming competitions!
