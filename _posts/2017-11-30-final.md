# Overall experience in SWE

Professor Downing is very effective at conveying a great deal of knowledge, from Python intricacies to SQL.

I believe a bit more meta-course information would make the course more meaningful. For example, a full-semester overview of the topics covered by day in the course and a brief introduction to each day's topic would give the course more motivation.

Furthermore, I am not sure if the group project structure is more beneficial than detrimental, as the group structure allows individuals to silo into different specialties; perhaps a structure more like OOP with every student completing something in SQL, something in Python, something in React, etc. would give students more breadth.

I am a big fan of the exposure to all of the tools we used throughout the course. Some of them I didn't like, such as PlanItPoker, bit they were all fun and beneficial to explore.
