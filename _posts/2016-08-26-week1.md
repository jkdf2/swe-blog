Libraries are always included when running Java programs - an import just makes it easier to access them with less typing. C++, on the other hand, requires an `include` statement to bundle the libraries, and the `using` keyword may be used to provide easier access to the objects.

Assertions work poorly for unit tests as they fail the entire program and prevent anything else from running. A unit testing framework overcomes this. Unit test with maximal coverage to increase your confidence in your code.
