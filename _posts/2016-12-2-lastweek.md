# Experience in the class

I shared this in my last blog. I think it's worth repeating now:

-----------------

I would have loved to have a project that built upon a previous project that showed us how much good use of the SOLID principles makes software easier to modify in the future.

I would also love it if Professor Downing would give us more personal anecdotes from his experiences working.

Right now, we are told to never use getters and setters, but I don't feel like I have any firsthand experience with why (although we do have some readings on the matter). Seeing the benefits via a project plus hearing them from Professor Downing would really help these SOLID principles sink in.

-----------------

Overall, I enjoyed what I learned about C++ but wish I had some more intuition about what it takes to architect a large-scale software application without making it painful to modify in the future.
