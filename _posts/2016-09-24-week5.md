# This week in OOP

Matthew and I struggled over the Netflix assignment. We used Boost, which may have been the worst idea ever - it made mocking, unit testing, and continuous integration a nightmare.

Classes were fun this week. Except for Wednesday when we had a phenomenal presentation in class by JPL employee Alex Menzies (including an awesome VR demo), we mostly talked about iterators and templating in C++, including the various levels of iterators and the abilities of each. It's important to support the highest iteration capability possible and to assume the least iteration capability when constructing something that uses iteration.

# In my way right now

I'm still freaking out about Applied Number Theory and trying to get ahead of things. Lots of exams coming up soon. I did one awful interview with Quora and I pretty much only have time for one interview a week, tops. I will probably still be looking in the Spring, but I don't really care if I don't find anything and take a summer to travel abroad.

# Next week

I'll be reviewing concepts from the beginning of the semester until now to prepare for exams.

# Tip of the week

[This](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/) is a handy chart of the various C++ iterators that I plan to reference in the future.
