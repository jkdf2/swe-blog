# This past week

We learned about optimizations for Collatz as well as some basic unit testing in Python.

# In my way right now

I only just got the textbook from the library lending service after requesting it the first class day. Time to speed read to catch up.

# Next week

Anticipating another easy week until team projects start picking up.

# Class takeaways

I usually write `.sh` files to run my Python code. I see we are using `makefiles` and `CMakeLists.txt` and I am looking forward to learning the utility of this approach.

# Pick of the week

I created a Reddit bot and learned a few random things from the various challenges I faced when creating it. One challenge was how to keep my bot running through internet disconnections and Raspberry Pi power outages.

Step one was [creating a `run_continuously.sh` script](https://github.com/jkdf2/TeaSalesBot/blob/master/run_continuously.sh) that logs errors as they happen and brings the bot back up.

Step two was adding a simple cronjob with `crontab -e` so that the Linux system on the Raspberry Pi will bring the script back up over reboots:

`@reboot /path/to/bot/run_continously.sh >> /path/to/bot/run.log 2>&1`
